An extension adds functionality to the system.  Extensions are normally installed by your System Administrator.  The guide to the procedure is within the Systems Adminstrator guide and can be [accessed here](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/customize/extensions/). Further information on extensions is available in the Developer Guide [here]( https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/extensions/).
